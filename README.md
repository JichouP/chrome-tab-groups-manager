# Chrome Tab Groups Manager

This extension always includes tabs in tab groups.
Even when you have a lot of tabs open, you can comfortably get on with the next task.
You can use Alt + Shift + LeftArrow/RightArrow to change the tab index to next or previous.
You can use Alt + Shift + UpArrow to make the current tab belong to a new tab group.
