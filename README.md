# Chrome Tab Groups Manager

This extension always includes tabs in tab groups.
Even when you have a lot of tabs open, you can comfortably get on with the next task.
With Alt + Shift + LeftArrow/RightArrow, you can swap positions with the left/right tab.
With Alt + Shift + UpArrow, you can add the tab in focus to a new group.
With Alt + Shift + DownArrow, you can collapse all tab groups that are not currently in focus.
